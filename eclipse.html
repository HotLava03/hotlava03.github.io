        <p class="normaltext mt-3 ml-3" style="color:#2c2f33;">If you are in this page you are probably a member of Eclipse's Discord or are just having trouble installing the program. Basically Eclipse is a program that makes you teams and comes with a few EasterEggs, such as the glitchy Console and some others. I also keep adding more features to it, so stay tuned. <strong>Warning: This program is made for Eclipse members only. If you don't know what is this, don't bother downloading the program, it will be completely useless for you.</strong></p>
        <div class="card bg-info text-center mt-3 ml-1" style="width: 550px">
            <h1 style="color:white">I can't run the program...</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="normaltext mt-3 ml-3" style="color:#2c2f33;">It is a common issue, and if it is a <em>Windows Protected Your PC</em> error, then it's very simple to fix it. Click on <em>More Info</em> and click on <em>Run Anyway</em>. <strong>Why is this happening? Is this Virus?</strong> No, I can't even make viruses since I don't have enough knowledge for that. Simply it's a rare type of program as this language is very old, plus it's a Console application. These are ran by your CMD (Command Prompt), but don't worry, navigation is easy and simple, even though there's no mouse involved.</p>
        <div class="card bg-info text-center mt-3 ml-1" style="width: 550px">
            <h1 style="color:white">The whole thing is glitchy</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="normaltext mt-3 ml-3" style="color:#2c2f33;">
            This shouldn't happen. Either you are running a version of Windows lower than Windows 10, or the program is indeed glitched for you. If you are running Windows 10 and this is happening, contact me in Discord: <strong>Lava#0654</strong>. The reason why you can't run this in Windows 7, or even 8 is that the CMD window is smaller on these Windows versions. It does not addapt, unfortunately, since the whole program is made pixel-by-pixel, all by hand, and I can't make a Windows 7 version right now. If I get enough requests I'll make a Windows 7 friendly version, but right now I can't.
