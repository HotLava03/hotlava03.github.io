        <h2 class="card-text ml-3 mt-2">About me</h1>
        <p class="mt-2 ml-4 text">I am currently a student, taking a programming course. My knowledge is limited, but I learn everyday. Maybe it's all about practise, being organized, and specially having fun on what you do. Programming gives you that feeling of doing something right, typing down orders for a little piece of electronical components to do what you want. And when it works, trust me, it's a good feeling. But if you see something called "java.lang.NullPointerException", it's all about the fun of knowing what you did wrong. Sounds fun, doesn't it?</p>

        <h2 class="card-text ml-3 mt-2">Spigot Development</h1>
        <p class="mt-2 ml-4 text">Learning the Bukkit API was generally a pain, but also a sweet and sour feeling. Hard-to-understand documentation, limited API tools, and other issues. But, since I like challenges, it's always fun to write a new plugin. Plugins like <a href="https://github.com/hotlava03/holosharp/" class="hyperlink">HoloSharp</a> are always fun to make, even though the amount of errors and bugs make it a big challenge. Again, that feeling of having something you made working properly and doing exactly what you wanted it to do is amazing, as hard work always takes you to success.</p>

        <h2 class="card-text ml-3 mt-2">Discord Bot Development</h1>
        <p class="mt-2 ml-4 text">This is where everything started. JDA (Java Discord API) was the first API I have ever worked with, and its documentation is just amazing. Really well-written library, which just makes your life easier. But, since I always love bigger challenges, I am taking more time on Spigot Development.</p>

        <p class="mt-2 ml-4 text">What took me to be interested in programming were both <a href="https://minecraft.net" class="hyperlink">Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://discordapp.com" class="hyperlink">Discord</a>. This Minecraft server is pretty new, but has constant updating. In around July of 2019 I became a Trainee Developer in it, which is where I implement my Spigot development the most. It is where I am taking most of my time to learn at this specific moment, outside of my programming course. Check it out <a href="https://mythicmc.info/" class="hyperlink">here</a>.</p>
